# Skills

## Passive
Every stage an enemy will get infected with the G-Virus, powering it up a little bit. This buff grows substantially over time so it's crucial to find the virus early and neutralize it before it becomes a serious threat.

Once defeated, you will obtain a G-Virus sample that can be turned into an Umbrella Terminal to exchange it for a keycard. Keycards can be used to open the corresponding weapon cases which you'll find on each stage.

## Primary
Basic melee attack meant for conserving ammo when it's safe to do so. Killing with this also has a chance for them to drop ammo on death.

## Secondary
Aim your held gun and fire. Each gun has ammo and reloads either passively or manually when out.

Each gun has its own unique properties, such as AoE or headshot multipliers.

## Utility
Take a quick step forward. Using this in anticipation of an enemy attack will perform a Perfect Dodge, refunding the cooldown and allowing you to retaliate with a devastating counterattack.

Using primary after a Perfect Dodge will perform a counterattack. These do leave you open so use them wisely.

## Special
Open up the weapon menu and swap weapons. Pressing secondary will drop the selected weapon. Tapping the key swaps to your last equipped weapon, shown on your back.

# Unique Item Interactions
Since cooldown items do almost nothing on HUNK, most of them have unique interactions that play around his ammo system instead


Backup Magazine - +1 fake bullet every time you complete a reload

Bandolier - Gives you half a mag of fake bullets on pickup

Alien Head - Increased ammo on pickup, same scaling and nerfed if Green Alien Head is installed

Brainstalks - Shots don't consume ammo while active


FAKE BULLETS can be fired without consuming any actual ammo, but are all lost when you reload or swap weapons

# Compatibility Stuff

### RiskUI
HUNK's custom weapon HUD is fully compatible with this UI overhaul
