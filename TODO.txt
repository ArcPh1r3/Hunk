ITEM DISPLAYS
MASTERY SKIN

- chests now give two mags instead of 1.5
- m19 damage: 300% > 320%- lots of earlygame shots are super close to a one tap but not quite, this should help save ammo in those cases
- m19 mag capacity: 7 > 16- it really just sucked okay
- m19 reload speed increased
- smg damage: 190% > 220%- just wasn't doing enough for how much ammo it eats up, this also lets it one tap wisps early
- slugger damage: 900% > 1200%- putting it in line with the other shotgun and magnum
- updated slugger model (icon not yet)
- added anti-tank rocket
- added atm-4
